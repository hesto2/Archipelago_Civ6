# Setup Guide for Civilization VI Archipelago

This guide is meant to help you get up and running with Civlization VI in your Archipelago run. Note that this requires you to have both Rise & Fall as well as Gathering Storm installed. This will not work unless both of those DLCs are enabled.

Windows is the only OS this has been tested on but feel free to let me know if it works on macOS as well. The setup steps should be the same with the exception of where files are located.

## How does this work with Archipelago? What is different?
Take a look at [this doc](https://github.com/hesto2/civilization_vi_apworld/blob/main/docs/en_Civilization%20VI.md) to get more information regarding what to expect here!

## Requirements

The following are required in order to play Civ VI in Archipelago

- Installed [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases) v0.4.5 or higher.\
   **Make sure to install the Generator if you intend to generate multiworlds.**
- The latest version of the [Civ VI apworld](https://github.com/hesto2/civilization_vi_apworld/releases/latest).

- The latest version of the [Civ VI AP Mod](https://github.com/hesto2/civilization_archipelago_mod).

- Tuner setting enabled so the archipelago client can communicate with the game

## Enabling the tuner
To enable the tuner, navigate to`YOUR_USER/Documents/My Games/Sid Meier's Civilization VI/AppOptions.txt` then do a search for `Enable FireTuner`. Set `EnableTuner` to `1` instead of `0`. __NOTE__: While this is active, achievments will be disabled.

## Mod Installation

1. After downloading each of the required items, follow these [instructions](https://github.com/hesto2/civilization_archipelago_mod/blob/main/README.md) for where to place the Civ VI AP Mod
2. After the host generates a game using your yaml (covered in the next section) you will be given a zip file containing a file you need to copy into the mod folder you just installed. This is covered in the last step of the mod [instructions](https://github.com/hesto2/civilization_archipelago_mod/blob/main/README.md) .

## AP World Installation

1. Unzip the downloaded Civ VI apworld zip file
2. Place the `civ6.apworld` file in your Archipelago installation's `lib/worlds` folder (Windows default to:
   `%programdata%/Archipelago`).

- If you have a `civ6.apworld` file from a previous version of the apworld, you **must** delete it, as it is no longer
  supported. Additionally, if there is a `civ6` folder in that folder, you **must** also delete it. Keeping
  these around will cause issues, even if multiworlds are successfully generated.

## Setting Up a YAML

All players playing Civ VI must provide the room host with a YAML file containing the settings for their world.
A sample YAML file for Civ VI is supplied in the Civ VI apworld download. Refer to the comments in that file for
details about what each setting does.

Once complete, provide the room host with your YAML file.

## Generating a Multiworld

If you're generating a multiworld game that includes Civ VI, you'll need to run it locally since the online
generator does not yet support it. Follow these steps to generate a multiworld:

1. Gather all player's YAMLs. Place these YAMLs into the `Players` folder of your Archipelago installation. If the
   folder does not exist, then it must be created manually. The files here should not be compressed.
2. Modify any local host settings for generation, as desired.
3. Run `ArchipelagoGenerate.exe` (without `.exe` on Linux) or click `Generate` in the launcher. The generation output
   is placed in the `output` folder (usually named something like `AP_XXXXX.zip`). \* Please note that if any player in the game you want to generate plays a game that needs a ROM file to generate,
   you will need the corresponding ROM files. A ROM file is not required for The Wind Waker at this stage.
4. Unzip the `AP_XXXXX.zip` file. It should include a zip file for each player in the room playing Civ VI. Distribute each file to the appropriate player.
5. Delete the distributed zip files and re-zip the remaining files. In the next section, use this archive file to
   host a room or provide it to the room host. \* If you plan to host the room on a local machine, skip this step and use the original zip file (`AP_XXXX.zip`) instead.

## Hosting a Room

If you're generating the multiworld, follow the instructions in the previous section. Once you have the zip file
corresponding to your multiworld, follow
[these steps](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en#hosting-an-archipelago-server) to host a room. Follow
the instructions for hosting on the website from a locally generated game or on a local machine.

## Connecting to a Room

You should have the zip file provided to you by the multiworld generator. You should also have the room's server
name and port number from the room's host.

Once you do, follow these steps to connect to the room:

1. Unzip the folder given to you and copy its contents (should include `NewItems.xml` and an `archipelago.json`, possibly more in the future) into the installed mod folder.
2. Start `ArchipelagoLauncher.exe` and choose `Civ6 Client`, which will open the text client.
3. Connect to the room by entering the server name and port number at the top and pressing `Connect`. For rooms hosted
   on the website, this will be `archipelago.gg:<port>`, where `<port>` is the port number. If a game is hosted from the
   `ArchipelagoServer.exe` (without `.exe` on Linux), this will default to `38281` but may be changed in the `host.yaml`.
4. Once you successfully configure and launch a game, the client should let you know it is connected and you will be ready to play!

## Configuring your game

When configuring your game, make sure to start the game in the Ancient Era and leave all settings related to starting technologies and civics as the defaults. Other than that, configure difficulty, AI, etc. as you normally would.

## Troubleshooting

- If you do not see the client in the launcher, ensure you have placed the `civ6.apworld` in the correct folder (the
  `lib/worlds` folder of your Archipelago installation).
